## MMCA - Multimdal Collaboration Analytics (MMCA) - A Literature Review

By Harvard Learning, Innovation, and Technology Lab (LIT)

## Structure

assets folder - contain images to style the website </br>
data - contains all the json data files </br>
scripts.js - JavaScript file that generates diagram using D3.js </br>

## TODO 

- adjust edge size depending on the number of connections
- adjust colors so that theyâ€™re consistent with modality
- move label inside boxes
- add correct URLs for papers
- add more information when users are hovering over elements (e.g., total count, but also breakdown by methods)
- add tabs so that the website is self-contained, We will provide the content of these pages (examples below), but for now you can just look for a professional-looking menu at the top of the page. These pages will contain:
    - more contextual information (definitions, etc.) 
    - a description of our framework
    - list of theories, takeaways, list of references etc. 
    - we also want to have a form so that other researchers can add their own data to the spreadsheet (after validation from us) 
    - being able to look at individual connections in more detail when clicking on edges (be able to see the lower level metrics and outcomes, similar to the previous visualization)
- we also saw a couple of issues: for example, why are performance / learning connected to process? They should be only connected to product. Double check that the connections are correct
