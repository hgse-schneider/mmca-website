            <p class="p-txt">This website has several functions. For non-academic users, it provides an entry point into multimodal collaboration analytics. It shows the most studied metrics and outcomes, and provides links to actual papers, where newcomers can then read detailed instructions for replicating the approach used by the authors. For academics, this website can help identify under-explored areas of study. For example, it seems that very few researchers have looked at group affect using multimodal sensing technology. Additionally, it provides a repository of approaches for capturing outcomes. For example, a researcher expert interested in group coordination might be an expert in eye-tracking methodologies, but unaware of other approaches using verbal or body movement data. The website provides access to papers that could be used to make informed choices on metrics and data types, supporting a more holistic approach for studying collaborative processes. To this end, we plan to periodically update the visualization database with articles beyond the last decade and future papers. Our long term vision is to keep developing the visualizations to provide an easy to use website for understanding multimodal collaboration analytics. Ultimately, this could become part of a project akin to the human genome project, but for collaborative metrics and outcomes. </p>
